This project focuses on variadic functions in C. Variadic functions are functions that can take a variable number of arguments. This is done using the va_start, va_arg, and va_end macros.

The project includes 4 tasks:

    0-sum_them_all.c: This function returns the sum of all its parameters. If the parameter n is equal to 0, the function returns 0.
    1-print_numbers.c: This function prints numbers, followed by a new line. The parameter separator is the string to be printed between numbers. The parameter n is the number of integers passed to the function. If separator is NULL, it is not printed.
    2-print_strings.c: This function prints strings, followed by a new line. The parameter separator is the string to be printed between the strings. The parameter n is the number of strings passed to the function. If separator is NULL, it is not printed. If one of the strings is NULL, the function prints (nil) instead.
    3-print_all.c: This function prints anything. The parameter format is a list of types of arguments passed to the function. For example, "ceis" means that the function should print a char, an int, a float, and a string. Any other character is ignored. A new line is printed at the end of the function.

This project is a great way to learn about variadic functions in C. It also covers some other important topics, such as how to use the const type qualifier and how to handle errors.

Here are some of the key takeaways from this project:

    Variadic functions are a powerful tool that can be used to write functions that can handle a variable number of arguments.
    The va_start, va_arg, and va_end macros are used to implement variadic functions.
    The const type qualifier can be used to prevent the value of a variable from being changed.
