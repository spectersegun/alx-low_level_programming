Sure, here is the rephrased text:

In this project, I learned and practiced the following:

    How to use macros in C programming.
    The most common predefined macros in C.
    How to include guard your header files.

I created four files to demonstrate my learning:

    0-object_like_macro.h: A header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024.
    1-pi.h: A header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359.
    2-main.c: A C program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from followed by a new line.
    3-function_like_macro.h: A header file that defines a function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x.
    4-sum.h: A header file that defines a function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers x and y.
