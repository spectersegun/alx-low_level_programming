This project focuses on function pointers in C. Function pointers are variables that store the address of a function. This allows us to pass functions around as if they were data, and to call them indirectly.

The project includes 5 tasks:

    0-print_name.c: This function prints a name.
    1-array_iterator.c: This function executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.
    2-int_index.c: This function searches for an integer. It returns the index of the first element for which the cmp function does not return 0. If no element is matched or size <= 0, the function returns -1.
    3-op_functions.c: This file contains 5 functions: op_add, op_sub, op_mul, op_div, and op_mod. These functions perform simple mathematical operations.
    3-get_op_func.c: This function selects the correct function from 3-op_functions.c to perform the operation asked by the user.
    100-main_opcodes.c: This function prints the opcodes of its own main function.

This project is a great way to learn about function pointers in C. It also covers some other important topics, such as how to use header files and how to handle errors.

Here are some of the key takeaways from this project:

    Function pointers are a powerful tool that can be used to pass functions around and to call them indirectly.
    Header files are a way to share code between different files.
    It is important to handle errors gracefully.

I hope this helps!
